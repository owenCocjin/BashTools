## Installation:

Preferred:
- Clone repo and add `bashTools` to PATH
> You must add 2 lines to your .bashrc. The following command will do it for you! The following assumes you put *bashTools* in `/usr/local/bin/`:
```
echo -e '\nexport PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/bashTools"\n. /usr/local/bin/bashTools/sources\n' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or you could manually add the lines:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/bashTools"
. /usr/local/bin/bashTools/sources
```
